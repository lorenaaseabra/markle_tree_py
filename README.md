# Merkle Tree in Python

This project implements a simple and functional **Merkle Tree** in Python, featuring:

- SHA-256-based tree construction
- Inclusion proof generation
- Inclusion proof verification
- Non-inclusion proof generation and verification

The structure is built using basic Python data types (`list`, `str`) and standard libraries (`hashlib`, `random`, `typing`).

## 📦 Features

- 🔐 Secure hashing using SHA-256
- 📄 Build a Merkle Tree from a list of string elements
- ✅ Generate and verify **Merkle inclusion proofs**
- ❌ Generate and verify **Merkle non-inclusion proofs**
- 🔄 Random element selection to demonstrate proof validation

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.
2. Run the main script:

```bash
python merkle_tree.py
